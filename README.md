# franklin-submit-wrapper

The Franklin submit wrapper is a sample project that showcases the integration capabilities available on the platform. This repository includes examples of two integrations:

* **Google reCaptcha V3** - which can be used to prevent spam and abuse on websites by verifying that form submissions are made by real users rather than bots.
* **Form Attachments** - which allow users to submit files along with their form submissions. The files are stored in Sharepoint using CF Worker as a proxy.
